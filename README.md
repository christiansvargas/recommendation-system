# Recommendation System

Hi, my name is **Christian**, and this project is for a personal music recommendation system. It works by using machine learning to figure out what to recommend to the user based on their current interests in music. The reason for this project was that I felt like the current music recommendations that apps like Spotify use often give inaccurate results for me, so I wanted to make a personalized system to have more music to enjoy. There were many different choices for what recommendation system I would make, but I chose music because I listen to it all the time while working, cleaning and doing many other mundane tasks. Also, I wanted to strengthen my understanding in Python and AI principles before next semester since I'll be taking an intro to AI course.
